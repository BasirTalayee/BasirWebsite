Observe, learn, and act in the present moment. Breathe, smile, and cherish this moment—it is your life.\n\n\nAs a lifelong learner, my adventures from Afghanistan to China, Qatar, and the USA have been driven by a strong commitment to curiosity, learning, service, innovation, and initiating impactful change.\nEquipped with insights from a diverse background in psychology, communication, journalism, marketing, business, cognitive science, epistemology, history, education, theater, Afghan culture, sufism, zen buddhism, and global citizenship, I leverage my knowledge, skills, and real-life experiences to foster a vibrant entrepreneurial and educational ecosystem and serve others.\n\nWe all come from unique backgrounds and carry stories that are uniquely ours. Curiosity is my beloved guide, helping me learn, ask better questions, practice courage, compassion, and build connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Connection is why we’re here; it is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives.” – Brené Brown\n\n\nI’m glad our paths crossed!"
