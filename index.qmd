  Get intoxicated with the wine of gratitude. Remember, everything is perfect, yet there is always room for improvement. Observe, learn, and act in the present moment. Breathe, smile, and cherish this moment—it is your life.</div>

As a lifelong learner, my adventures from **Afghanistan to China, Qatar, and the USA** have been driven by a strong commitment to curiosity, learning, service, innovation, and initiating impactful change.

Equipped with insights from a diverse background in psychology, communication, journalism, marketing, business, cognitive science, epistemology, history, education, theater, Afghan culture, sufism, zen buddhism, and global citizenship, I leverage my knowledge, skills, and real-life experiences to foster a vibrant entrepreneurial and educational ecosystem and serve others.

We all come from unique backgrounds and carry stories that are uniquely ours. **Curiosity** is my beloved guide, helping me learn, ask better questions, practice courage, compassion, and build connections.
